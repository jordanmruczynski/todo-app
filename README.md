A mid-level "to-do list" application written to use and learn the new architectural pattern and Vaadin framework. 
I tried to show some good practices, and solutions to common problems, e.g. Hibernate "n+1".

The application includes sample best practices and solutions to outline skills for future recruitment processes.
